  <h2>Early Teaching Experience&nbsp;<small>(2020 – 2024)</small></h2>
  <p>During my engineering studies I taught mathematics and physics to high‑school and undergraduate students,
     tailoring explanations to a wide range of backgrounds. Over four years I prepared
     more than&nbsp;150 pupils for exams and competitive entrance tests, with an emphasis on
     problem‑solving strategies and intuition.</p>

  <h2>Doctoral Teaching&nbsp;<small>(2024 – present)</small></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Algebra oral exams: I conduct individual oral examinations (analogous to the French colle)
        for engineering students, assessing conceptual understanding and guiding them toward clear, structured proofs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Open‑Access Learning Platform</h2>
  <p>Building on my teaching experience, I have devlopped during my engineering studies a free educational website
     that will host concise courses and interactive exercises in mathematics, physics and English.
     The platform targets learners from high‑school through preparatory classes, emphasising
     clarity, minimal prerequisites and plenty of worked examples.</p>
